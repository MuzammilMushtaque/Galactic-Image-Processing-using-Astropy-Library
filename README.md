This Python code is the Galaxy Image analysis script for studying the distribution of dust, gas, and metallicity in a galaxy at high redshift. Below are the key features and functionalities of the code:

1. **Libraries and Modules:**
   - The code imports various libraries and modules, such as NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for plotting, Astropy for handling FITS files, and others.

2. **File Reading:**
   - The `fits` module from Astropy is used to open and read FITS files containing 3D data of the galaxy. The input file is named 'input_midplane_3d.fits.gz', and gzip compression is applied.

The input file is named "input_midplane_3d.fits.gz" and it is a compressed FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) file. FITS is a common format in astronomy for storing and exchanging scientific data. Let's break down the information provided in the header summary:

- **Filename:** `input_midplane_3d.fits.gz`
  - The file has a `.fits.gz` extension, indicating that it is a FITS file compressed using gzip.

- **Header Information:**
  - **No. 0 (PRIMARY):**
    - **Name:** PRIMARY
    - **Version (Ver):** 1
    - **Type:** PrimaryHDU (Primary Header Data Unit)
    - **Number of Cards (Cards):** 63
    - **Dimensions:** (256, 256, 256, 3)
    - **Format:** float64 (64-bit floating-point numbers)

- **PrimaryHDU:**
  - The file has a primary HDU, which is the main header unit containing metadata and the primary data array.

- **Dimensions of the Data Array:**
  - The data array has four dimensions: (256, 256, 256, 3).
    - The first three dimensions (256, 256, 256) suggest a 3D array, indicating the spatial dimensions (X, Y, Z) of the data.
    - The fourth dimension with a size of 3 suggests that there are three data components or channels.

- **Data Format:**
  - The data values in the array are stored as 64-bit floating-point numbers (float64). This format is commonly used for representing numerical data with high precision.

- **Metadata:**
  - The header contains 63 cards, which are metadata entries providing information about the data and its acquisition.


3. **Data Processing:**
   - The script extracts parameters from the FITS header, such as the sidelength and distance, which are essential for further calculations.
   - Gas and dust density data cubes are extracted from the FITS file, and total dust mass in the galaxy is calculated based on the dust density and the cube's spatial properties.

4. **Optical Depth Calculation:**
   - The code calculates optical depth for different wavelengths using a loop over predefined values of kappa (opacity coefficient). The optical depth distributions are then visualized and saved as PDF files.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Matplotlib is used for creating visualizations. The optical depth distributions are plotted and saved as PDF files with proper labeling and color bars.

6. **Column Density Calculation:**
   - The script calculates column densities of dust and gas along different axes and visualizes them as heatmaps, which are then saved as PDF files.

7. **Metallicity Calculation:**
   - Metallicity, defined as the ratio of dust column density to gas column density, is calculated and visualized as a heatmap. The result is saved as a PDF file.

8. **Modularity and Functions:**
   - The code is organized into a modular structure with a main function named `column_densities()` that encapsulates different steps of the analysis.

9. **Execution and Timing:**
   - The main function is called when the script is executed. The script records the start and end times of execution, and the elapsed time is printed.

10. **Output Files:**
   - The visualizations (PDF files) are saved with meaningful names, such as 'optical_depth_freq.pdf', 'input_column_density.pdf', 'column_density_metallicity.pdf', etc.

11. **Units and Constants:**
   - Physical constants like the mean molecular weight (`mu`) and the conversion factor for kiloparsec to meters (`con_kpc`) are defined and used throughout the code.


Note: It's crucial to ensure that the code is used in an appropriate context just for the study purpose, and the required input data files are available for accurate execution. Although, it is highly prohibited to publish any sort of results from the input file.
